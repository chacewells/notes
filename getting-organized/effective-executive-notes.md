# Four Major Realities for Executives
1. Time belongs to someone else
2. Forced to keep "operating" unless they take positive action to change their reality
3. In an organization - only effective if others make use of executive's contribution
4. WITHIN an organization - can see org clearly, but outside world only through analysis and reporting

# Five Practices of Effective Executives
Habits of the mind

1. Know where your time goes - systematically manage what little time you can control
2. Focus on outward contribution - gear efforts to results, not work
3. Build on strengths, not weakness - own strengths & others' strengths
4. Focus on few areas where superior performance produces outstanding results
5. Effective decisions; decisions are systematic - right steps in right sequence; few, fundamental, strategic decisions
