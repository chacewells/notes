You're transitioning from execution-focused IC work to strategic leadership—a shift that requires fundamentally different organizational systems. Here's a comprehensive approach to support your new reality:

## Core Organizational Systems

**Task & Project Management:**
- **Notion** or **Obsidian** for your central command center. Both excel at linking related information (meeting notes → action items → project plans). Notion is more structured; Obsidian better for networked thinking.
- **Linear** or **Jira** for technical work tracking (you likely already use these)
- **Todoist** or **Things 3** for quick capture and personal task management

**Key System Architecture:**
Create interconnected spaces for: Active Projects, People (mentees, stakeholders), Technical Opportunities, and a Weekly Review process. Link everything—your mentoring notes should connect to specific engineers' growth plans, which tie to project assignments.

## Essential Reading Resources

**For Strategic Thinking & Planning:**
- *"The Effective Executive"* by Peter Drucker - timeless principles for knowledge work effectiveness
- *"Making Things Happen"* by Scott Berkun - project management specifically for technical leaders
- *"The Staff Engineer's Path"* by Tanya Reilly - addresses exactly your transition challenges

**For Systems Thinking:**
- *"Getting Things Done"* by David Allen - foundational methodology for managing multiple streams of work
- *"Building a Second Brain"* by Tiago Forte - knowledge management system design
- *"Thinking in Systems"* by Donella Meadows - will strengthen your higher-level thinking

## Practical Implementation Framework

**Weekly Architecture:**
- **Monday Planning:** Review roadmaps, identify blockers, plan mentoring conversations
- **Wednesday Check-ins:** Stakeholder communications, POC progress reviews
- **Friday Retrospectives:** What moved forward? What's stuck? What insights emerged?

**Daily Capture System:**
- Quick-capture tool always available (phone app, notepad)
- 15-minute end-of-day review to process captures into your system
- Separate "Now," "Soon," and "Someday" buckets

**Context Switching Strategy:**
- Time-box similar activities (all stakeholder comms in one block)
- Use transition rituals between deep work and people work
- Maintain a "parking lot" for ideas that emerge during focused time

Since you're strengthening design-oriented thinking, consider adopting **design thinking workshops** for your innovation efforts—they'll help you approach technical opportunities more systematically while engaging your team.

The key insight: your new role requires you to be a "system designer" for both technical solutions and team effectiveness. Your organizational system should mirror this—interconnected, scalable, and optimized for synthesis rather than just execution.

What type of work do you find most challenging to keep organized currently—the mentoring relationships, the technical planning, or the stakeholder management?
