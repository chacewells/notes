## 1. The Speed of Innovation
Recall the Gartner Hype Cycle introduced earlier in the course. This is a framework for understanding the development of expectation and attitudes towards technologies over time. New technologies often rise to a “peak of inflated expectations” before falling into a “trough of disillusionment.” We may likely be experiencing this rapid rise with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). From the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, countless articles, papers, and other media have been published, inflating the expectations of large language models (LLMs). The 2024 Gartner Hype Cycle now places GenAI on the opposite side of the slope, descending toward the trough of disillusionment (Jaffri, 2024), so we may now expect to see an increasing number of articles deriding or ridiculing this particularly visible hype cycle and GenAI in general.

### The Gartner Hype Cycle

Adapted from: (Jaffri, 2024)

While not all technologies follow these dynamics, it is important that leaders keep an eye on potential future technologies and think strategically about how these tech advances may impact their businesses and industries in the near, medium, and distant futures. From developments in laboratories, through testing, use case identification, and adoption, technologies can take 10 to 20 years, or more, to mature and reach mass adoption.

Consider the zipper and Velcro. How long do you think it took these technologies to gain mainstream adoption?

### Zipper

The modern zipper was patented in 1913. In 1923, zippers appeared on rubber boots and in 1925 they made their first appearance on clothing. It took 12 years for the zipper to mature to its common use case.

(Anthony & Westerman, 2025)

### Velcro

Velcro was conceived by George de Mestral in 1948 while on a hike. It was first patented in 1955 and appeared on the first Velcro shoes in 1968. Velcro took 13 years to mature, and many more years to reach mass adoption.

(Anthony & Westerman, 2025)
The same more or less holds true for other technologies such as the organic light emitting diode (OLED) which took around 25 years from initial patent to inclusion in Samsung Galaxy phones in 2010 with active matrix OLEDs. Of course, this time frame will not hold true for every technology, but it is useful to keep in mind.

The Gartner Hype Cycle is not the only framework available for examining technology measuring and forecasting. Different organizations will naturally offer different perspectives on various technologies. These are useful tools for leaders to keep abreast of developing and maturing technologies.

As we explore some of the emerging technologies in the following pages, keep the Gartner Hype Cycle in mind. Also keep in mind some technologies that have arisen—or failed—during your lifetime.

## 2. Integrated Photonics
In the rapidly evolving landscape of emerging technologies, integrated photonics stands out as a transformative approach to optical system design and miniaturization. Traditionally, optical devices such as spectrometers, LiDAR systems, and fiber-optic communication networks relied on large-scale, free-space optical components (Anthony & Westerman, 2025). However, advancements in semiconductor fabrication have enabled the integration of optical components onto a single chip, revolutionizing multiple industries.

Fundamentals of Integrated Photonics
Integrated photonics can be best understood through its parallel to the evolution of electronic circuits. Just as microelectronics revolutionized computing by integrating transistors onto semiconductor chips, integrated photonics seeks to embed optical components—such as lasers, waveguides, resonators, interferometers, and detectors—into a compact, scalable format, mirroring the miniaturization seen in integrated electronics (Tran et al., 2022; Anthony & Westerman, 2024). By replacing traditional bulk optics like lenses and mirrors with chip-scale photonic architectures, integrated photonics enables more compact, efficient, and scalable optical systems. This advancement supports a wide range of applications, from high-speed communications and sensing to optical signal processing and quantum computing.

Definition
Integrated photonics is the miniaturization of optical systems onto a chip using semiconductor-like fabrication techniques.

Benefits of Using Photonic Circuits
Manufacturing Process
The fabrication of photonic circuits uses processes very similar to the layer-by-layer etching and deposition techniques employed in semiconductor manufacturing, often utilizing silicon wafers as a substrate (Tran et al., 2022; Anthony & Westerman, 2024). This allows integrated photonics to leverage existing semiconductor fabrication plants (commonly referred to as “fabs”) and design tools, facilitating mass production and improving cost efficiency. By leveraging and extending these established processes, integrated photonics aims to create high-performance optical devices at scale, significantly reducing the size and complexity of traditional optical components.

Comparison to Traditional Optics
Conventional optical systems typically involve large optical assemblies with extensive free-space propagation of light. These systems rely on discrete lenses, mirrors, and beam splitters to manipulate light. In contrast, integrated photonics routes and controls light on-chip using components such as waveguides and miniature laser sources, allowing for greater miniaturization and integration with existing electronic systems (Tran et al., 2022; Anthony & Westerman, 2024).

While the initial development cost for specialized integrated photonic circuits can be high, the cost benefits become significant with mass production, much like in the semiconductor industry (Tran et al., 2022; Anthony & Westerman, 2024). The ability to scale production enables widespread adoption across industries, including telecommunications, autonomous vehicles, and biomedical sensing. Additionally, the shift from traditional optics to integrated photonics facilitates greater energy efficiency, a key advantage in data centers and high-speed computing applications.

Current Applications and Limitations
Integrated photonics is actively transforming several sectors, most notably in high-speed data communication and optical radar-like sensing, leveraging the advancements and infrastructure of the established semiconductor industry (Tran et al., 2022; Anthony & Westerman, 2024).

## 3. Advanced Laser Sensing
In recent years, integrated photonics has emerged as a transformative technology in the field of advanced sensing, enabling highly sensitive and miniaturized detection systems that span a wide range of industries. Through the development of optical circuits on a chip, photonics has not only enhanced existing sensing techniques but also unlocked entirely new possibilities for precision measurement and environmental monitoring (Zhang et al., 2023).

Sensors are integral to modern society, particularly in optimizing energy systems and process industries in the context of global warming and environmental pollution. Laser-based optical sensors are particularly well-suited for achieving accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, portability, speed, safety, and intelligence in sensing applications.

Fundamentals of Laser Sensing
The fundamental basis of laser sensing lies in the interaction between photons and matter at a microscopic level, which is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Various laser-based sensing techniques exist, each distinguished by their physical principles, implementation strategies, and hardware requirements.

Current Applications
Photonics-Enabled Sensing
Ring Resonators for Ultra-Sensitive Detection
Non-Contact Measurement Techniques: Laser Ultrasound
Photoacoustic Effect: The Science Behind the Laser Ultrasound
Industry Perspective
The newly developed terahertz laser by MIT researchers, which simultaneously achieves high power, a tight beam, and broad frequency tuning, is seen as valuable for a wide range of applications in chemical sensing and imaging. Notable potential applications include chemical detection in outer space (selected for a NASA mission), improved skin and breast cancer imaging, and detecting drugs and explosives.

Integrated Photonics and Advanced Laser Sensing Summary
Integrated photonics and advanced laser sensing are emerging as transformative forces in optical system design, promising to redefine industries from high-speed data communication to autonomous vehicle navigation and precision healthcare diagnostics. By miniaturizing traditional optical components onto semiconductor chips, this technology not only mirrors the revolutionary impact of microelectronics but also unlocks new capabilities in environmental monitoring and material inspection through innovations like ultra-sensitive ring resonators and laser ultrasound.

Despite its vast potential, significant challenges remain. Manufacturing costs, scalability issues, and the integration of photonic systems with existing electronic infrastructures continue to pose hurdles. Moreover, the path to commercialization is marked by distinct stages—from the current expansion in data centers and LiDAR applications to the medium-term emergence of specialized uses in healthcare and quantum technologies, and ultimately the long-term vision of ubiquitous, fault-tolerant systems.

In this rapidly evolving landscape, leadership is crucial. Business and policy leaders must proactively monitor technological advancements and strategically invest in research, development, and talent to bridge the gap between innovation and market-ready solutions. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, leaders can navigate the complexities of commercialization, mitigate risks, and harness the transformative power of integrated photonics. This proactive approach will ensure that organizations not only adapt to the changes brought about by these emerging technologies, but also drive future breakthroughs in optical sensing and communication.

Remember also that most companies will adopt technologies like these rather than invent or advance them. Think about the mobile applications you use. Phone manufacturers create the technologies, but businesses create value by identifying new ways to work using those technologies. Similarly, advances in computers or communication or DNA sequencing will be created by a small number of researchers and companies, but used to transform processes in many companies. Learning to work with, and transform with, these technologies still require effort to understand technology trends and innovate with technologies, but it will be of a different type and scale than those aiming to advance the frontiers of the technologies themselves.

## 4. Quantum Technologies
Quantum computing represents a fundamental shift in computational paradigms, offering the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Unlike traditional binary systems, which process data as bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers leverage quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously (Schneider & Smalley, 2024a). This capability enables unprecedented computational power for specific applications, particularly in optimization, cryptography, and complex simulations (AWS, n.d.). However, quantum computing remains in the early stages of development, with significant technical challenges that must be overcome before widespread adoption. In parallel, quantum communication offers breakthroughs in secure data transmission through principles such as quantum key distribution and quantum entanglement (McKinsey & Company, 2025).

Important note - ﻿Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field, with new discoveries and innovations emerging regularly. The content in this section reflects a specific moment in the evolution of quantum technology. Our focus is introducing the foundational concepts that underpin quantum computing—principles that remain essential even as the field continues to evolve.

The examples of quantum applications included in this section are not meant to be a comprehensive list. Instead, they are intended to provide a few basic ideas of what quantum computers may be capable of, helping you begin to understand the kinds of problems this technology could eventually address. By reflecting on how quantum is applied, you may be able to identify new areas in which the characteristics of quantum would fit.

Fundamentals of Quantum Technologies
To fully grasp the transformative potential of quantum technologies, it is crucial to understand the quantum mechanical principles that distinguish it from classical computing. Quantum technologies represent a fundamentally different approach, leveraging the strange and powerful behaviors of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that would be impossible or impractical for classical computers.

Recommended Video
Watch this video from the MIT Department of Physics that explains quantum mechanics. It discusses the shift from the first quantum revolution of information processing to the current era of Quantum 2.0. We are now leveraging quantum mechanical properties at a chip level to build technologies like quantum computers.

Quantum Explained
Visualizing Bit and Qubit
Quantum computers derive their power from quantum mechanical principles that differ significantly from classical computing. Superposition is the property of a quantum bit (qubit) that allows it to exist in a simultaneous combination of both the 0 and 1 states, unlike a classical bit which can only be one or the other. Entanglement allows two or more qubits to become linked in such a way that their states are intertwined, regardless of the distance separating them. Quantum interference allows the different probabilistic outcomes in a quantum computation to interact with each other, enabling the amplification of correct answers and the suppression of incorrect ones. If these features seem strange and difficult to understand, do not worry. Some of the best physicists in the world have struggled to explain and truly understand quantum concepts.

Superposition
Entanglement
Quantum gates
Probabilistic nature
Unlike classical bits, which can exist in one of two distinct states (0 or 1), qubits have the unique ability to exist in a superposition of states. This means that a qubit can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, as opposed to classical bits, which are constrained to a single state at any given moment. This property allows quantum computers to process a vast number of possibilities at once, dramatically increasing their potential for parallel computation. For example, one logical qubit could represent values from 0 to 7, whereas a classical bit can only represent 0 or 1. This inherent parallelism allows quantum computers to solve certain types of problems exponentially faster than their classical counterparts.

Navigating a Maze: Classical Bits vs. Quantum Qubits
Imagine being stuck in a maze. In a classical computer, bits operate as binary switches (0 or 1) to sequentially explore each path in the maze, marking dead ends and retracing steps—a brute-force approach limited by linear processing. For example, solving a maze with 100 paths would require testing each individually, a time-consuming process.

In contrast, qubits leverage superposition and quantum interference to evaluate paths in parallel. Rather than “testing all paths at once,” qubits encode possible solutions as probability amplitudes—mathematical values that behave like waves. These amplitudes can:

Constructively interfere: Amplify the correct path’s probability (e.g., waves combining to form taller peaks)
Destructively interfere: Cancel out incorrect paths (e.g., waves neutralizing each other)
Imagine standing in the maze and sending out waves that ripple through all paths simultaneously. Paths leading to dead ends produce waves that cancel each other, while the exit path’s waves reinforce into a detectable signal. (Schneider & Smalley, 2024a)

Current Applications and Limitations
Quantum Computing
Quantum computing holds great promise across a variety of industries due to its ability to exploit quantum mechanical principles such as superposition and entanglement. These capabilities enable quantum systems to process and analyze information in ways that classical systems cannot (Schneider & Smalley, 2024b). Although still in its early stages, quantum computing is anticipated to revolutionize several fields, offering potential advancements that were previously unattainable.

Optimization Problems
Material Science and Drug Discovery
Machine Learning and AI
Quantum Communication
Quantum communication focuses on utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics to enhance communication capabilities, particularly in terms of security and, potentially, for new functionalities like a quantum internet. It leverages nonclassical states, such as superposition and entanglement, to achieve advantages over classical communication methods. (Lewis, 2022)

This field promises significant advancements in data protection and privacy, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity and secure networking. Unlike the more distant horizon of practical quantum computing, quantum communication technologies are already transitioning from research to real-world applications, providing more tangible near-term benefits.

Just as classical computers rely on interconnected components, future large-scale quantum computers will need efficient ways to communicate quantum information between multiple processors. However, current methods for interconnecting superconducting quantum processors primarily use “point-to-point” connections, which require a series of transfers between network nodes and lead to compounding error rates. Researchers at MIT have developed a new interconnected device designed to enable direct communication among multiple quantum processors. This device supports scalable, “all-to-all” communication, meaning that all superconducting quantum processors within a network can communicate directly with each other.

Quantum Sensing
Quantum sensing involves utilizing quantum systems to create sensors with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy for measurements in various areas. Quantum sensing is a tested technology with broad applications in commercial products (e.g., medical devices), in services (e.g., navigation), and as an enabler of internal processes (e.g., quality control). It enables many types of measurements that are currently too difficult, not precise enough, or simply unfeasible otherwise.

## 5. Development and Adoption Timelines
It is important to be aware of emerging technologies because it allows individuals and organizations to anticipate their potential future impact and understand the “dynamic journey ahead” as these technologies evolve from the lab to the market. It can take a significant amount of time, on the order of 10–20 years, or more, for an idea invented in the lab to reach the marketplace. However, other technologies can mature and achieve adoption very quickly. Therefore, being aware of these early-stage technologies can help you plan for, and be ready to use, the right technologies at the right times. In this section, we will capture the current landscape and future potential of the technologies discussed in the previous sections. (Anthony & Westerman, 2025)

Factors Influencing Photonics Adoption
Several factors will influence the rate at which integrated photonics is adopted. First and foremost, advances in silicon photonics and hybrid electronic-photonic integration techniques will be essential for optimizing performance and manufacturability (Shekhar et al., 2024).

To achieve the scale necessary for widespread adoption, significant investments in photonics semiconductor fabrication facilities (“fabs”) are crucial (Zhang et al., 2023). As manufacturing processes mature and become more efficient, costs will continue to decrease, enabling broader deployment.

The demand for energy-efficient, high-speed optical communication in sectors like data centers and telecommunications will be a major catalyst for adoption (Shekhar et al., 2024). Additionally, the growing importance of advanced sensing—whether for healthcare diagnostics, environmental monitoring, or industrial applications—will further drive the need for photonic-based solutions (Expert Panel, 2024). Finally, developments in fields such as AI, which increasingly requires specialized hardware, and the rise of spatial computing interfaces could create new applications and demand for integrated photonics in unforeseen areas.

Quantum Technologies
The path to the widespread commercialization of quantum computing is expected to unfold in several distinct stages. These stages will be shaped by a combination of technical breakthroughs, strategic government and corporate investment, and the gradual emergence of practical and economically viable use cases. While each stage presents its own set of challenges, they collectively highlight the promising trajectory toward the broader adoption of quantum computing.

Advances in quantum communication, QKD, and quantum sensors make it likely that we will see commercial use of some types of these technologies in the near-to-medium term. As organizations with advanced needs begin to use and improve these technologies in real-world applications, the technologies should reach the reliability and cost levels that other businesses will begin to adopt them.

Quantum computing is not yet as advanced for practical uses as quantum sensing or communication. However, industry experts are projecting practical use growing in the foreseeable future.

Conclusion
As we have explored a set of cutting-edge innovations—from the precision of photonics and laser sensing to the disruptive potential of quantum computing, and beyond—it is clear that no single technology holds all the answers. It is important to note that our exploration is not exhaustive. Rather, effective leaders must recognize that each emerging capability follows its own maturation curve and that being mindful of hype cycles will help to avoid overinvesting too early or missing critical inflection points.

Preparing for tomorrow’s industry landscape means more than just tracking today’s capabilities—it requires continuous horizon scanning and strategic patience. Just as “becoming AI-ready” is an ongoing journey of learning and adaptation, so too must organizations stay attuned to where technologies are headed. Different sectors will gravitate toward different innovations, but all will benefit from leaders who balance enthusiasm with pragmatism, understand the lifecycle of emerging tools, and keep their eyes firmly on the horizon.

However, we must keep in mind that it is not the technologies themselves that transform organizations—it is the people who deploy, adapt, and champion them. Ultimately, understanding the technology landscape is really about envisioning how the capabilities of the new tools can enable new ways of doing business. The first law of digital innovation—technology changes quickly but organization change much more slowly—will be just as true for photonics and quantum as it was for internet, mobile, and AI. Tracking technology trends can speed your ability to innovate the way your company works. But in the end, you still need to build the organizational and leadership capabilities to envision and drive change in organizations that are built upon people, not just technology. In the next module, we will shift our focus from tools to talent, exploring strategies for positioning people to thrive in an ever-evolving world of innovation.
