## 4. Upskilling for Collaboration
The increasing prese of artificial intelligence and automation requires organizations to rethink how their workforce collaborates and adapts. Leaders must proactively develop upskilling initiatives that enable employees to work seamlessly with advanced technologies. This forward-thinking approach is essential for building a resilient team that not only understands the capabilities of automated systems but also knows how to mitigate potential risks.

Dimensions of Human-Automation Interaction
Effective upskilling initiatives begin with a deep understanding of the nuanced relationship between human operators and automated systems. Leaders must recognize that challenges such as disuse—where a lack of trust leads to underutilization—and misuse—where over-reliance results in complacency—directly impact how training programs should be designed. By grasping these dynamics, leaders can tailor upskilling strategies that not only enhance technical proficiency but also cultivate critical decision-making skills and situational awareness. This foundational insight is essential for ensuring that employees are well-prepared to interact safely and effectively with complex automation.

Disuse and Misuse of Automation
The concepts of misuse and disuse of automation are critical aspects of human-automation interaction that can significantly impact the effectiveness and safety of automated systems.

Disuse of automation refers to the intentional neglect of decision aids or automated systems by operators, often stemming from a lack of trust in technology or a perception that it offers no benefits.

Misuse of automation, on the other hand, involves the over-utilization of automated systems due to over-trust, where operators may neglect to check the results or functioning of the automation. This over-reliance can lead to automation complacency and automation biases, where errors or malfunctions in the automated system may go unnoticed, potentially resulting in negative consequences.

(Brauner et al., 2022)

### Value Added Human Skills
The focus of upskilling and reskilling should be aligned with the needs created by human and automation collaboration. As more automation is introduced in workflows, the skills needed will evolve. As we understood in the previous section, there are different dimensions of human-automation interaction. Building upon that, let us focus on some of the skills that have become the sine-qua-non in current upskilling initiatives.

Successful human automation collaboration necessitates a blend of technical acumen, domain-specific knowledge, strong interpersonal and communication skills, a deep commitment to safety and ergonomics, and a nuanced understanding of the ethical and practical dimensions of working with intelligent machines. The ongoing evolution of AI and robotics will continue to shape and expand the necessary skills for effective human collaboration.

Understanding the capabilities and limitations of automation
Maintaining situational awareness
Communication and interaction skills
Technical literacy
Domain expertise and conceptual understanding
Responsibility and accountability
Workers need to develop an understanding of what automated systems, including AI, can and cannot do. This includes comprehending the robot’s abilities and limitations, which is crucial for building appropriate trust and avoiding both disuse and misuse of automation. Understanding these limitations also helps in knowing when human intervention is necessary. (Faccio et al., 2022)

Skills for Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration
The digital transformation era calls for a convergence of expertise from various fields. Effective upskilling involves building interdisciplinary knowledge that allows team members from different backgrounds—such as engineering, data science, and business—to communicate fluently and work together toward shared objectives. This means promoting an understanding of AI fundamentals, model-driven thinking, and the practical challenges of integrating automated systems into everyday workflows. A human-centered approach remains crucial to ensure that technology serves as an aid rather than a replacement for human insight.

Interdisciplinary knowledge and understanding
Effective communication abilities
Model-driven thinking and knowledge integration
Understanding AI and automation fundamentals
Human-centered approach
Collaborators need to develop a foundational understanding of the concepts, methodologies, and challenges within each other's disciplines. For instance, computer scientists need to grasp production engineering principles, while engineers should understand the capabilities and limitations of AI and data processing. This does not require becoming an expert in every field, but rather having sufficient working knowledge to facilitate communication and identify common ground. (Brauner et al., 2022)

In essence, the digital age presents both challenges and opportunities. By embracing lifelong learning and proactively developing skills relevant to digital technologies, leaders can help position individuals and teams to thrive in the future workforce, contributing to and collaborating with increasingly intelligent and automated systems across various sectors.

## 2. Crafting a Powerful Vision of the Future
Digital transformation is an ongoing process. You can begin the process by using force, but it will only be successful if you persuade your employees to be part of the change. That is why having a vision is so important. A good vision is short, simple, sets direction, and is something everyone can believe in. The vision must be grand and aspirational. People must feel that the vision is not just good for the company, but also for themselves.

What Is a Great Vision?
To drive an effort that is organization wide, leadership needs to come up with a clear vision of where the organization is headed. It is not just about crafting a statement that has been agreed upon in the C-suite level meetings. It needs to be something that everyone can believe in, not just the leaders. It must be energizing to inspire people to go beyond the status quo and constantly improve the way they work. Let’s have a look at a few examples of vision articulated by industry leaders:

### Nike

"Moving forward together. Our purpose is to move the world forward through the power of sport. Worldwide, we're leveling the playing field, doing our part to protect our collective playground and expanding access to sport for everyone." (Nike, n.d.)

Nike do not want to simply sell you shoes. They want to be part of your life.
### Rio Tinto

"We're finding better ways to provide materials the world needs, now and in the future." (Rio Tinto, n.d.)

Rio Tinto are not solely focused on resource extraction. They are committed to continuously improving how materials are sourced to meet the world's needs in a responsible and forward-looking manner.
### Schneider Electric

"Life Is On." (Schneider Electric, n.d.)

Schneider Electric are not just providing energy solutions. They aim to empower individuals and organizations to use energy more efficiently and sustainably, making progress accessible to all.
### Huntington Ingalls Industries

"We shall build good ships here; at a profit if we can; at a loss if we must; but always good ships." (HII, n.d.)

​The company was launched more than a century ago with that vision. The motto "always good ships" is still used today.
### Kaiser Permanente

### Schindler

### Key Characteristics of a Great Vision
A great vision is short, simple, and sets a clear direction everyone can believe in. It is aspirational, engaging, and has measurable indicators of progress. A compelling vision is essential for driving progress and inspiring belief within an organization. It is key to aim beyond incremental improvements; a “faster caterpillar” will falter when competitors learn to “fly.” A strong vision sets a bold direction, challenging outdated ways of thinking and empowering teams to embrace innovation and adaptability.

Engaging People in the Vision for AI-Powered Transformation
A compelling vision is not just leadership jargon—it is a critical tool for challenging outdated assumptions and guiding process transformation. A strong vision paints a picture of a future that is significantly different and better than the present, pushing the organization beyond incremental improvements. A good vision is short, compelling, and something that everyone—employees, customers, investors, and managers—can believe in. Visions that possess these qualities will facilitate the next leadership capability, engagement.

## 3. Engaging Employees and Executives in the Change 
Any organization driving digital transformation will likely need to overcome resistance from within. Change is hard and is often resisted in support of the status quo. By ensuring that all stakeholders are engaged in the transformation process, leaders can address the concerns that create resistance. Beyond that, leaders can show how the vision benefits employees and not just leaders, and they can create excitement around the future goal. This engagement will instill a sense of belonging towards the organizational vision. People become a source of energy and innovation when they are afforded an opportunity to participate in the transformation process (Buvat et al., 2018).

Newport News Shipbuilding did not impose quality and efficiency requirements on its workers. Instead, it focused on making it easier for workers to do good work. This approach reflects the principle that a compelling organizational vision should not only be credible but also beneficial to employees, ensuring their needs are prioritized alongside leadership goals. By focusing on enhancing the daily experiences of employees, Newport News Shipbuilding fosters greater engagement, satisfaction, and productivity, ultimately benefiting both the workforce and the leadership.

Recall DBS’s vision “Let’s make banking joyful.” More than just a slogan, this vision served as a rallying point, engaging employees at all levels in the transformation process. It was not merely about improving customer satisfaction, it was about creating an environment where employees felt empowered to identify and eliminate sources of frustration. Every unnecessary wait time and every cumbersome process became an opportunity for improvement, reinforcing the idea that everyone had a role to play in making banking truly joyful.

By setting a vision that employees could connect with and actively contribute to, DBS not only redefined the customer experience but also transformed its internal culture. This case demonstrates how a well-crafted vision can align an organization’s collective efforts, inspiring innovation and meaningful change from within.

Organizational transformation requires participation from all members of the organization, so leaders must ensure active engagement in transformational initiatives. A clear, compelling vision provides all stakeholders with a beacon—a reference point that enables each individual to engage at their specific level and capacity. This vision not only outlines the strategic direction for change but also makes the transformation relevant to everyone, from executives to front-line employees. From this reference point, each individual can understand how they can contribute to the transformation process, be it through ideas or energy.

Leadership Activities to Encourage Engagement
There are several ways of ensuring that transformation is seen as a collaborative activity rather than as a top-down order.

The DBS case provides some hints as to how leaders can engage their teams in change. Encouraging and acting on bottom-up feedback and allowing employees to pursue their own initiatives allowed the whole organization to participate in transformation. Specifically, DBS implemented opportunities where any employee could propose improvements to processes. Employees were empowered to find ways to cut the pain points that lead to wait times. Leaders highlighted successful implementations and praised the employees who were responsible. As a result, employees felt they were a part of the transformation and contributing to beneficial changes.

Now, recall the other case study from the beginning of this module. Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News Shipbuilding offers a striking example of how effective employee engagement can drive digital transformation, particularly in a unionized environment. Leaders focused on improving the working experience, which naturally set the stage for broader operational improvements and greater efficiency through the adoption of new technologies, such as digital design.

Transformational change

In essence, Newport News Shipbuilding’s engagement strategy highlights the importance of aligning digital transformation initiatives with the interests and well-being of employees. Their success demonstrates that when employees are treated as partners in change—where their insights are valued and their concerns addressed—resistance can be overcome, paving the way for a more efficient and forward-thinking organization.

The Three Lenses Framework
It is important for leaders to recognize that change is often met with resistance not because employees are unwilling to change, but because they interpret change differently based on their perspectives. Leaders must recognize that a single approach to driving transformation will not work for everyone—what convinces one person may not resonate with another, and as we have said transformation happens by persuasion, not by force. Change is hard, and leaders must find the right ways to “sell” it by addressing concerns through multiple viewpoints.

A powerful framework for understanding and addressing resistance is the three lenses of change. This is a framework that has been taught at MIT for more than 20 years. The three lenses are rational, political, and cultural. Each lens represents a different way individuals interpret a situation. Some individuals may see things more clearly through a rational lens, while others consider political or cultural aspects to be more essential or convincing.

Successful change lies at the intersection of these three elements. People tend to favor one of these lenses, but it is important to consider all of them.

Adapted from: (Carroll, 2001)

By considering these perspectives, leaders can develop more effective engagement strategies.

Applying the Three Lenses: Asian Paints
Asian Paints’ digital transformation demonstrates the critical need to address the three distinct lenses—rational, political, and cultural—to achieve successful organizational change. Through the rational lens, the initial transformation project was justified by clear business benefits, including a significant potential reduction in working capital, improved data clarity, and enhanced operational efficiency. However, the purely logical appeal of these benefits was not enough to secure universal buy-in.

Looked at through the political lens, some leaders in the 13 regions objected to the standardization inherent in the transformation because it threatened their long-held autonomy. These leaders feared that standardizing processes and centralizing information might strip them of their authority and diminish their ability to tailor strategies to local market conditions. Some feared a loss of power and control over regional operations, undermining their influence and operational independence.​​​

From the cultural lens, the transformation project clashed with entrenched values and practices within the organization. Salespeople, in particular, resisted the change because it redefined their roles. They were concerned that this shift would erode the personalized service that had long been a cultural cornerstone at Asian Paints and damage the relationships they believed customers valued.​​

​​​This case underscores that even when rational benefits are compelling, leaders must also address political power dynamics and cultural resistance to effectively drive digital transformation.​​

Reflect
​​​Before reading further, consider some ways that leaders could address the political and cultural concerns that arose in the Asian Paints case.​​

The Rational Lens: Making the Business Case
​​The rational lens focuses on logic, data, and facts. Employees who view transformation through this lens want to understand the details of the business case—why the change is necessary, the benefits, ​and how it will work. To engage stakeholders from this perspective, leaders must be prepared to clearly articulate their rationale, demonstrate measurable benefits, and provide structured plans.

Clearly articulate the reasons for change using concrete evidence, such as market trends, competitive pressures, or operational inefficiencies.

﻿Demonstrate measurable benefits by sharing projected improvements in productivity, cost savings, or customer satisfaction.

﻿Provide structured implementation plans that outline the steps, timeline, and expected outcomes of the transformation.

For example, if a company is implementing AI-driven automation in customer service, a rational argument might include data on how AI reduces response times, improves accuracy, and allows human employees to focus on the most complex issues. Some managers and employees may appreciate this rational approach, but others may see the situation in a different way.

Strategies for employing a rational lens include:

Goals and objectives

Architecture

Business cases

Process and organization redesign

Metrics

The Political Lens: Navigating Power and Influence
The political lens considers how change affects power dynamics, roles, and influence within an organization. Employees who view transformation through this lens may resist because they feel their authority, status, or decision-making power is being challenged. Others may be persuaded to change through actions that exert or reallocate power. Leaders can acknowledge these concerns by identifying key stakeholders, directly outlining how teams will be impacted, and positioning employees as champions of transformation.

Determine individuals or groups that will be most affected by transformation. Consider their interests, motivations, and concerns.

Form alliances with people who support the transformation initiatives. Ensure that they share the vision and then ask them to help promote the changes.

​Recognize that leaders must sometimes use their authority to drive change. However, this power should be exercised responsibly and ethically, with consideration for the impact on individuals and groups.

For example, if a hospital introduces AI-powered diagnostics, doctors, and medical staff may fear that automation will reduce their expertise or control over decision-making, or experienced doctors may fear being supplanted by newer ones who are more comfortable with AI tools. Engaging key medical professionals in the implementation process—by allowing them to guide AI integration and validate its use—can turn potential resistance into active support.

Strategies for employing a political lens include:

Accountability for results

Transparency on process and performance

Non-public (or public) pressure

Reassignment/firing

Ignoring the political dimension of change can lead to hidden opposition, where employees subtly discourage adoption or delay progress. Leaders must recognize power structures and align transformation with the interests of those who hold sway in the organization.

The Cultural Lens: Aligning With "How We Do Things Around Here"
The cultural lens focuses on the values, practices (formal and informal), and hidden assumptions that shape how we perceive and behave within an organization. Resistance from this perspective arises when transformation feels like it clashes with long-standing norms or disrupts the identity of the workplace. To address cultural resistance, leaders can rely on organizational beliefs and habits, properly frame changes, and employ storytelling.

Understand the organization’s cultural DNA—what values, practices, and hidden assumptions define how work gets done.

​Frame change in a way that aligns with existing values and assumptions, rather than presenting it as a complete departure from the past.

Use storytelling and role models to show how transformation fits naturally into the company’s evolution.

Provide opportunities for employees to voice concerns and present their ideas.​

For instance, if a construction company is shifting from paper-based workflows to digital platforms, resistance may stem from the culture of hands-on, in-person work. Instead of positioning digital tools as a radical departure, leaders can emphasize how they enhance long-standing values of craftsmanship, efficiency, and worker safety.

Strategies for employing a cultural lens include:

Burning platform (if possible)

Clear vision

Engaging employees in the change

Encouraging and recognizing the right behaviors

Celebrating “wins”

Failing to consider cultural resistance can result in employees passively ignoring change, even if they outwardly comply. Leaders must respect cultural norms while guiding their evolution to align with transformation goals.

Applying the Three Lenses for Effective Change Leadership
Affective leaders do not rely on just one lens—they use all three to craft a well-rounded change strategy. When introducing transformation, leaders should ask:

Rational lens: Are we making a strong logical case for change?
Political lens: Are we addressing how change impacts power structures and influence?
Cultural lens: Are we considering cultural norms and values in how we position change?
By integrating these perspectives, leaders can anticipate and address different forms of resistance, increasing the likelihood of successful transformation.

Leaders should also recognize that everyone naturally views the world through their own dominant lens. By being aware of your own lens—and understanding that others have different perspectives—you will better understand the root causes of concerns and resistance and therefore be able to respond more effectively to underlying behaviors. To build a more adaptable team, it is important to include members whose dominant lenses differ from your own, ensuring a well-rounded approach to decision-making and tailored strategies for overcoming challenges.

Understanding that employees interpret change differently is essential for overcoming resistance. The three lenses—rational, political, and cultural—provide a framework for leaders to tailor their approach and engage employees in ways that resonate with their perspectives. Change is not just about logic and strategy; it is about relationships, power dynamics, and deeply held beliefs. By considering these factors, leaders can build trust, reduce opposition, and guide their organizations through transformation with confidence and clarity.

Remember, leaders will encounter people influenced by one of the three lenses discussed above. Each person has one dominant lens through which they understand the world. To actively engage people in the transformation journey, each type of person may need to be persuaded using their dominant lens. Leadership teams must be able to consider rational, political, and cultural lenses all at the same time.

Take a moment to consider which is your dominant lens. Take the following poll and view the results to see where you place in comparison to your peers.

## 4. Governing for Progress, Not Just Prevention
Once you have created a vision and set up mechanisms to engage people in transformational initiatives, you must steer the course using governance mechanisms. It is important to establish clear rules and processes that guide the organization in the right direction, while also preventing it from going astray. Although many people think about governance as a way to stop bad things from happening, it should be about encouraging the right levels of sharing and coordination, not just preventing unwanted action. In other words, governance should be more of a steering wheel than a brake pedal. (Westerman, 2024).

The Role of Governance in Transformation
Governance plays a crucial role in ensuring that digital transformation efforts move in the right direction. It should encourage innovation and experimentation, while ensuring those innovations are aligned and scalable. When reviewing opportunities, it should encourage sharing, reuse, and coordination, in addition to ensuring safety and ROI. Without clear governance structures, transformation efforts risk fragmentation, misalignment, cybersecurity weaknesses, regulatory compliance issues, and inconsistent execution across different business units. While governance can sometimes be seen as bureaucratic, effective leaders recognize that it is not about preventing error—it is about guiding the organization in the right direction while maintaining flexibility for innovation.

Governance must serve as a mechanism for continuous course correction. Transformation is not a one-time event but an ongoing process that requires frequent adjustments based on new insights, market conditions, and technological advancements. Effective leaders put in place governance structures that regularly review progress, identify roadblocks, and adjust strategies as needed.

Leaders should understand that governance is a tool that enables organizations to scale transformation efforts while minimizing risks. The most successful leaders view governance not as a bureaucratic burden, but as an essential system of guardrails that keeps innovation moving in the right direction. By setting clear accountabilities, balancing central and local needs, allocating resources wisely, and ensuring ongoing oversight, leaders can create governance structures that empower—not hinder—meaningful transformation.

Key Mechanisms
The key to successful governance is balance—providing enough structure to maintain alignment and efficiency while allowing flexibility for teams to innovate and execute effectively.

Leaders can utilize several important mechanisms in order to build more robust governance structures. Five key mechanisms are: the chief digital officer (or equivalent), digital liaisons, shared digital units, governance committees, and dedicated resources. Each of these mechanisms plays a unique role in aligning digital initiatives with business objectives and fostering a culture of innovation and accountability.

Chief digital officer
Digital liaisons
Shared digital units
Governance committees
Resources
​The chief digital officer (CDO), or an equivalent, is a critical leadership role responsible for unifying the company’s digital vision. The CDO transforms “digital cacophony into a strategic symphony” by aligning digital activities, evaluating and improving products and processes, and equipping teams with essential tools and resources. Whether operating independently or in conjunction with other digital units, a strong CDO—with support from top management—ensures that digital transformation is coordinated across the enterprise.

​(Westerman et al., 2014)

Robust digital governance hinges on a blend of strategic leadership and coordinated action. The chief digital officer provides unified vision and direction, while digital liaisons ensure that local units align with this vision. Shared digital units deliver centralized expertise and infrastructure, governance committees set policies and allocate resources, and dedicated resources empower all these mechanisms to function effectively. Together, these five mechanisms form an integrated framework that not only drives innovation and digital transformation but also ensures accountability, consistency, and sustainable growth in the AI era.

Governance for Innovation
For leaders guiding digital transformation, it is important to establish governance structures that encourage innovation. Effective leaders recognize that governance is not about controlling every aspect of transformation; it is about providing structure while allowing room for experimentation, learning, and adaptation.

A common mistake organizations make—typically exemplified by organizations in the conservative quadrant of the digital mastery framework—is over-governing transformation efforts in an attempt to maintain control. Leaders may create rigid approval processes, centralized committees, and layers of oversight, believing that this will reduce risk. While this approach may ensure compliance and consistency, it often discourages innovation by making it difficult for teams to experiment with new technologies or adapt to changing conditions. For instance, a healthcare organization introducing AI-driven diagnostics may slow adoption if every modification requires multiple layers of executive approval. Instead, leaders must define essential guardrails—such as data privacy, security, and ethical considerations—while empowering teams to explore solutions within these boundaries.

At the same time, too little governance, often exemplified by organizations in the fashionista quadrant of the digital mastery framework, can be equally problematic. When innovation is completely decentralized, different departments or regions may adopt conflicting solutions, making integration difficult and leading to inefficiencies. Leaders must ensure that governance provides enough unifying standards, architecture, and tools to align innovation efforts with enterprise-wide goals.

Consider a global consumer goods company adopting AI-powered demand forecasting. If different regional teams deploy separate AI models without coordination, the company may struggle with inconsistencies, conflicting insights, and inefficiencies in supply chain planning. In this scenario, governance could establish common data standards and value measurement protocols, while allowing regions the flexibility to tailor their methods to local market conditions.

Finding the right level of standardization versus flexibility is a core leadership responsibility. Certain elements—such as cybersecurity policies, regulatory compliance, and enterprise-wide AI ethics—must be centrally governed to protect the organization. However, areas such as product innovation, customer engagement, and localized process improvements may benefit from decentralized execution. Leaders should encourage teams to innovate within a structured framework, ensuring that new ideas align with broader strategic goals without unnecessary constraints.

Sustaining governance over time is also critical. Governance is not a one-time setup—it must evolve alongside technological advancements, market shifts, and organizational learning. Leaders should establish regular reviews of governance structures, ensuring that policies remain relevant and that innovation continues to thrive. This could involve quarterly governance check-ins, adaptive policies that evolve with AI and automation trends, and continuous feedback loops from innovation teams.

Ultimately, leaders must view governance as a mechanism to enable innovation, not restrict it. The best governance models provide clarity, accountability, and alignment without suffocating creativity. By finding the right balance between control and agility, leaders can create an environment where digital transformation is both disciplined and dynamic, structured yet adaptable, and scalable without losing its innovative edge.

Key Questions for Governing Digital Innovation
Effective governance is not a static framework—it must evolve alongside an organization’s transformation efforts. Leaders must continuously assess whether their governance structures are enabling progress or unintentionally creating barriers. Without regular evaluation, governance can become misaligned with strategic goals, slow decision-making, or fail to support innovation effectively.

To ensure governance remains a dynamic and enabling force, leaders should ask key questions that reveal potential gaps, inefficiencies, or risks in their current approach. These questions help clarify who is responsible for transformation, how decisions are made, and whether governance structures are balancing control with flexibility. Leaders who proactively reflect on these areas can adjust their governance models to better support digital and AI-driven transformation.

Who oversees the transformation, and how is it being driven?

It is important to have clarity regarding who is responsible for leading the transformation efforts within the organization.

By regularly assessing governance effectiveness, leaders can ensure that structures remain relevant, efficient, and aligned with transformation goals. Governance should not be a rigid set of rules, but a living system that evolves as the organization grows and technology advances. Leaders must be willing to refine decision-making processes, adjust accountability structures, and remove bottlenecks that slow innovation. By continuously revisiting fundamental governance questions, leaders can keep their transformation efforts on track, ensuring that governance remains an enabler of progress rather than an obstacle to change.

## 6. Sustaining Momentum
Before we move on to the remaining leadership capabilities, let’s return one last time to the DBS case study to see how they utilized leadership capability to initiate change and, importantly, to sustain this transformation.

Understanding the role of leadership in regard to creating a clear vision, engaging stakeholders, and ensuring proper governance is an essential first step in driving transformational change. However, it is still only a first step. To sustain digital transformation, leaders must go beyond structural changes and top-down impetus to actively shape an organizational culture that is able to engage in continuous change—adaptable, innovative, and prepared for the future. A culture of digital and AI readiness is one where employees are comfortable to share their ideas, experiment with new ways of working, embrace continuous learning, and see change as an opportunity rather than a disruption.

Leadership is central to shaping this culture. Leaders set the tone by creating an environment where curiosity, adaptability, and continuous learning are valued. As values are promoted throughout an organization, the activities and practices of employees reflect these values. It is leadership’s responsibility to identify and embed values of AI-readiness in order to encourage transformative practices. It is through these values and practices that organizational culture is created and reflected.

Additionally, a key feature of digital transformation is the evolution of IT teams and leaders from supporting roles to strategic partners. IT and business leaders must learn to communicate together in ways that are mutually understood. Developing a strong strategic relationship with open communication between these parties will be the final leadership capability we will discuss.

Looking ahead, in Module 6, “Building the Capability to Thrive,” we will examine this AI-ready culture in greater depth. There, we will consider the evolving role of IT teams and the values and practices that both support and emerge from an AI-ready organizational culture. Keep the foundational leadership activities discussed in this module in mind as we widen the scope to consider the larger culture itself. Remember, creating a compelling vision, engaging employees, and developing robust governance are a starting point. By rounding out the other leadership capabilities outlined in the 2×2 digital mastery framework, e.g., partnering with IT leaders and ultimately cultivating an AI-ready culture, transformative change can be maintained.
