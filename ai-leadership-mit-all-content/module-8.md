## 2. Managing the Human Element
Transformation is an ongoing process. It does not end with strategies or technologies or project completion dates. It lives and breathes through the people who embrace and drive it. It is a fundamental change in mindset. As we close this course, remember that every framework, tool, and initiative we have discussed only succeeds when individuals choose to engage, learn, and lead. By focusing on the human dimension, cultivating shared purpose, building the right culture, and helping people see themselves in the transformation, you ensure that digital transformation is not just a moment in time, but a sustained, people-powered journey.


Building a People Empowerment Strategy for the AI-Powered World
By now you understand the importance of Westerman’s law, the fact that technologies change quickly but organizations change much more slowly. However, what is not always considered is how the nature of work and the needs of the workforce are changing too.

To ensure that AI-powered digital transformation is truly effective, organizations must recognize and address its broad reach, understanding that AI implementation affects all roles, not just those within IT. Providing training and career development support to help all employees adapt to new AI-driven technologies and processes is essential for ensuring that all members of the organization are able to engage in the change.

Our research shows that organizations—and parts of organizations—are following different strategies with regard to preparing their people for the changes that will come with increasingly AI-augmented business practices.

Broadly speaking, we have found that organizations are following four distinct strategies:

Doing Nothing
Predicting Job Trends
Building Digital Skills
Helping Workers Choose Their Own Futures

Transforming Employee Learning
As organizations plan retraining and upskilling strategies, it is important to keep in mind that these activities themselves are being affected by AI technologies. Even as people learn new skills, the organization responsible for delivering those skills needs to transform.

No longer limited to delivering training and compliance programs, Chief Learning Officers, and their Learning & Development (L&D) teams, need to become strategic partners who shape enterprise capabilities and culture. While relatively few have stepped up to the challenge yet, research shows that these “Transformer CLOs” are redefining what learning means in their companies. They are leading three major transformations to ensure their companies are delivering the skills needed, in the way they need to be delivered: (1) rethinking learning goals, (2) reinventing learning methods, and (3) redesigning learning departments to support continuous, agile learning aligned with business strategy. Even if you are not responsible for L&D in your organization, it is worth understanding these shifts.

Transforming Learning Goals
Transformer CLOs are shifting focus from merely developing job-specific skills to cultivating broader capabilities such as digital thinking, adaptability, and a growth mindset. Leadership development is restructured to align with organizational strategy. Companies like Cargill and UBS are democratizing learning by extending high-quality development opportunities beyond top-tier leaders to all employees. Standard Chartered is emphasizing experimentation and data-driven decision-making. This new focus helps organizations build resilience by preparing employees for tasks and challenges that may not yet exist, emphasizing mindsets over narrow competencies.

Transforming Learning Methods
These CLOs are moving from a course-focused approach to an employee-focused one. They are embracing digital tools and peer-led models to personalize and scale learning experiences. Traditional classroom training is being replaced or supplemented with digital formats, mobile apps, games, and AI-powered recommendation engines. Learning is becoming more real-time, delivered in smaller pieces using a variety of formats. Organizations like DBS Bank and Accenture promote experiential learning, simulations, and real-time feedback to make training more relevant and engaging. Programs like GANDALF Scholars at DBS and “connected classrooms” at Accenture show how peer teaching and distributed learning environments can boost participation, reinforce learning, and empower employees as both learners and teachers.

Transforming Learning Departments
To support their expanded mandate, CLOs are redesigning L&D departments to be leaner, more strategic, and more collaborative. Rather than simply delivering content, they act as curators and co-creators, combining internal expertise with external resources to offer timely, high-impact learning. Teams increasingly use agile development models to create and refine learning modules, while data analytics helps evaluate and continuously improve content effectiveness. Peer learning forums, such as Deutsche Telekom’s “From Experts, For Experts,” show how bottom-up learning can be identified and scaled by an adaptive learning function.

In essence, these digital and AI tools not only broaden access to learning but also create dynamic, on-demand experiences that adapt to the ever-changing needs of the modern workplace, setting them apart from the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional classrooms.

Forum: Is Your Organization Prepared to Train for the Future?
In this forum, you will assess how well your organization is prepared to train employees for a digitally driven future. Reflect on existing programs, potential gaps, and how training efforts align with broader transformation goals.


Improving Career Development for Everyone
Companies tend to be very good at developing their high potential employees. A small percentage of people, selected for their potential to become the firm’s future top leaders, receive regular learning and mentoring support to develop the technical and managerial skills they need to advance in the organization.

However, in today’s times of rapid transformation, that is not enough. Employees at all levels may be concerned that their jobs will be destroyed, or their skills invalidated, by AI-powered change. Although companies cannot invest the same amount of time and resources in every employee as they do in their high potentials, they can do more to help every employee develop their careers.

First, organizations must ensure that opportunities for growth are visible to each employee. Second, they can provide opportunities for employees to learn and practice the skills they need. And third, organizations should establish feedback loops and coaching methods to help tune their development.

Providing Visibility Into What Is Possible
Employees cannot pursue opportunities they do not know exist, yet many companies lack visibility into internal roles and career paths. Even human resources (HR) teams often struggle to track openings across regions or business units. As a result, organizations frequently hire externally rather than matching internal talent to available roles.

Employees need guidance on potential new roles they can move into, whether upwards, horizontally, or diagonally in the organization. Most people do not know about, much less understand, other opportunities that are less obvious. Could an accountant move to a cybersecurity role, or a help desk person move to advanced manufacturing, or a receptionist into a lab technician role? Helping people understand alternative next steps from their current position can help them identify where they want to go inside the organization, instead of leaving them to look for opportunities elsewhere.

Tools like GE Digital’s Career Discovery and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s (UPMC) Explore Careers help employees identify potential roles, skill gaps, and training opportunities, making career growth more accessible.

Internal job postings may highlight missing skills without showing how to bridge the gap. Companies like Unilever address this through structured programs that help employees set goals, build skills, and gain certifications. Encouraging managers to see internal transfers as growth opportunities rather than risks further strengthens internal mobility.

Building diverse internal networks also plays a key role in career development. Employees who connect with colleagues in different roles gain valuable insights into career possibilities and skill requirements. Companies like Accenture and DBS Bank foster these connections through global learning programs and peer mentoring. By making career pathways clearer and promoting internal talent, organizations create more engaged, adaptable workforces.﻿

Providing Opportunities to Learn and Practice
Organizations can help employees develop essential skills. Companies like Allianz, for example, use AI-driven learning platforms to recommend training based on employees’ existing skills and learning preferences. UPMC has defined structured learning pathways for employees at different career stages, bundling courses into self-paced programs that build both professional and personal skills. These structured approaches help employees gain expertise while aligning their development with organizational needs. ﻿

Beyond formal training, employees need hands-on practice to apply new skills and reflect on their experiences. Companies like UBS, DBS Bank, and Fidelity Investments use simulations, games, and live practice sessions to reinforce learning. Northeastern University partners with employers to create real-world projects tied to students’ job roles, allowing them to build practical experience while contributing to the organizations. Stretch assignments, where employees take on new tasks without switching jobs, further support skill development, yet many companies lack systems to make these opportunities visible.

Organizations benefit when they invest in internal talent. Ignoring internal candidates forces employees to look elsewhere for growth, worsening talent shortages. UPMC now includes career aspirations in performance reviews to encourage career conversations between employees and managers. Schneider Electric’s internal talent marketplace helps employees explore stretch roles through short-term projects and mentorships, giving managers a low-risk way to assess potential hires. By prioritizing skill development and internal mobility, companies strengthen their workforce while retaining top talent.﻿

Tuning Through Ongoing Feedback and Coaching
Effective coaching and feedback create an environment of continuous growth and self-improvement. When employees receive clear, constructive insights into their performance, they not only understand their current strengths and areas for development but also feel empowered to pursue new opportunities for learning. This open dialogue encourages a culture of trust and transparency, where individuals are encouraged to reflect, adapt, and strive for excellence beyond traditional performance reviews.

Pernod Ricard’s Let’s Talk Talent program shifts performance management toward ongoing career development, with managers acting as career coaches. Employees create talent profiles outlining their achievements and career goals, which managers and the global talent team use to guide discussions. Regular career conversations ensure employees receive the support they need, even beyond their direct managers. Strong companies make career coaching a core management responsibility, helping employees develop the skills needed for both current and future roles.

Ensuring managers provide quality feedback requires more than policy enforcement—it demands support and accountability. UPMC addresses this by coaching managers on talent development and using Anytime Check-in, a tool that enables real-time feedback from colleagues and supervisors. This system helps employees track their progress while allowing managers to reference feedback for performance reviews. By embedding feedback into daily workflows, companies create a culture where continuous coaching strengthens both individual careers and organizational success.

Conclusion
Developing these pillars offers a cost-effective and integrated method of career development that replaces traditional, fragmented methods. Companies are no longer relying on separate systems for career discovery, learning, and feedback. Instead, they are uniting these elements into a single framework that automatically adapts to the needs of each employee, reducing the burden on HR and managers. This integrated, technology-driven approach enables employees to access personalized learning pathways, receive timely feedback, and navigate career opportunities with ease, ultimately building a more agile and resilient workforce.

## 3. Co-Creating the Future
Throughout this course, we have explored the foundational ideas of digital mastery in the AI era, examining the leadership capabilities that drive and sustain change and surveying emerging technologies from digital twins to collaborative robots. We have seen how AI can augment operations, products, and processes, and we have discussed the human-centered side of transformation—upskilling, engagement, and culture. But just knowing the concepts is not enough. You need to take concrete action to turn future potential into current reality.

​​​Leaders must choose clear strategic pathways to help their organizations flourish in the AI-powered future. This means setting direction, empowering innovation, and steering the course, and then repeating the process again and again. ​​

It is impossible to know what the future looks like, but you can create the foundations for success in your technology and people. Then, each step you take reveals new opportunities while paring back others.

​​In the end, it is continuous learning and development, in your people, your processes, and even the markets you work in, that will create success in whatever future you choose to pursue.

To wrap up the course, we have listed seven key steps that will help you to turn the concepts from the course into an actionable plan. Ultimately, organizational transformation is not achieved through isolated actions or a single strategic vision. It requires a shift in mindset, habits, and ways of working, grounded in purpose and shaped by context. The following steps serve as guideposts for navigating complex change, offering practical orientations rather than prescriptive formulas. They emphasize learning, adaptability, and the importance of engaging people throughout the organization.

As you start each, realize you will need to keep working on them continually as you drive your first transformation and all of the others that become possible for the AI-powered future.

Begin With Purpose
Effective transformation begins with clarity of purpose. This purpose should go beyond metrics or market position and instead reflect the organization’s broader reason for being. It should give people a reason to want to be part of the organization, and of the change. It should be clear enough for people to recognize what progress looks like, but flexible enough to allow them to contribute to shaping and expanding it.

Begin With Purpose
Flip
What is your vision for the AI-powered future?

Why is it better than your current course—for everyone, not just investors or managers?

How will people know when they are making progress toward the goal?

Flip
Articulating a compelling vision of the future can motivate and engage others in working toward its realization.

Engage Your People
Leaders create change by energizing people to make the change. They allocate resources and set direction, and then people execute on the change efforts. However, while computers tend to do what they are programmed to do, people are different. They do what they want to do. So, your job as a leader is to persuade employees to engage in the transformation and contribute their effort, enthusiasm, and ideas.

Engage Your People
Flip
How is the vision good for employees, not just customers or investors or managers?

What will you do to help people understand the vision, and how it affects them?

How can employees contribute to building out the vision?

What types of influence (soft or hard) do you need to apply to get people on board?

Flip
If you engage your people in the change, it will develop momentum. If not, you will constantly struggle to overcome resistance, both active and passive, and you will not benefit from the ideas of the people who know your business the best.

Move Quickly and Learn
Transformation is a process of constant learning. You cannot plan every step along the way, especially as technologies improve and customer preferences change. Even as you think about your purpose and long term goals, get started now. Where possible, focus on efforts through which you can move quickly, fail cheaply, and learn always. You may also need to make investment that create a foundation for those innovation processes.

Move Quickly and Learn
Flip
What foundational investments—in technology, data, skills, etc.—are needed to help the company be ready for the future?

Where can you start projects that move quickly and cheaply, enabling you to resolve uncertainties and make progress toward your vision?

How will you ensure that each team has what it needs, while also prompting it to push beyond what it is already doing?

Flip
Moving quickly does not have to be exhausting. If you create the right conditions, you can create momentum and keep it going by establishing the right foundation, energizing teams, and constantly celebrating the progress they make.

Steer the Course Through Governance
Organizational transformation is not driven by a single initiative but through the management of a diverse set of efforts. This includes a balance of low-risk, incremental improvements and ambitious, forward-looking projects. By combining short-term wins with long-term investments, organizations can build adaptive capacity, maintain momentum, and create lasting impact.

It is important to establish governance processes that ensure everyone is making progress in the right direction, while not preventing innovation that might identify valuable new directions. This means rules that aim to prevent bad consequences, but also methods to make it easier to move in the right direction. It should also include methods to ensure that each project builds on what others are doing, so that the transformation can scale efficiently without creating a new mess of legacy spaghetti.

Steer the Course Through Governance
Flip
How will you allocate funding across different activities?

How will you manage risks to cybersecurity, business continuity, information accuracy, and other operational goals?

What steps will you take to coordinate across projects?

How will you stop or redirect projects that are not making progress?

Flip
Governance should be more than just the brakes on your vehicle; it should also be the accelerator and the steering wheel. If you have all three, you can move quickly and safely toward making the vision a reality.

Ensure That Technology and Business Work Closely Together
Technology produces value only when it is used to improve a product or process. That means technology people cannot do it alone. It requires shared effort by people who know technology and people who know the business. With the right collaboration, each can contribute toward a solution that works for the company and its customers, while also being technically effective and maintainable. While each group has its own work to do independently of the others, success will happen when the people who need to interact can do it well with trust, shared understanding and sense of joint purpose.

Ensure That Technology and Business Work Closely Together
Flip
How well do your business and IT people collaborate now? How can you improve it?

Are you using agile practices? If not, how can you start?

How are you building shared responsibility, and shared recognition, in each project?

Flip
In any transformation, some tech people will focus only on technical tasks, while some business people will focus on only business tasks. However, the hard and most important part is ensuring that you manage the interface between the two sides so that the solutions can provide value both now and into the future.

Build Culture, Not Just Projects
Successful transformation cannot rely solely on top-down directives; it also requires initiative from across the organization. Leaders play a critical role in creating an environment where individuals at all levels are encouraged to take initiative, experiment, and contribute to change. This involves providing support, granting permission, and ensuring psychological safety—particularly when outcomes are uncertain. The aim is create a new mindset and new ways of working so that everyone feels empowered to move the company in the right direction, without having to be asked.

Build Culture, Not Just Projects
Flip
How can individuals at all levels contribute to the conversation?

How are you recognizing achievement at all levels?

How are you addressing concerns that people may have about the direction?

What are you doing to help people build the skills and experience they need to thrive?

Flip
Culture is what happens when the boss leaves the room. With the right culture, transformation is more than just a set of projects. When done well, it becomes an engine of innovation that creates new energy in its employees, even as it creates a continuous stream of new value for the company.

Never Stop Growing
Great companies never stop growing. Each achievement creates new possibilities to do more. The leader’s job is to push for tomorrow while ensuring people are happy today. This is a tough challenge. Like a great coach, the leader pushes the team to meet each challenge, celebrates each win, and then focuses on the next challenge.

Never Stop Growing
Flip
What are you doing to create a growth mindset in your people?

How do you celebrate wins?

How do you capture innovation ideas from all levels of the company?

Are your leaders, at all levels, pushing hard enough?

Do your people feel appropriately recognized and rewarded?

Flip
The goal is not only to foster employee satisfaction with their roles, but also to cultivate a healthy dissatisfaction with the status quo. While employees should feel fulfilled in their work, they should also be motivated to question existing processes and seek continuous improvement. This productive dissatisfaction is essential for driving innovation and ensuring the company remains competitive in an AI-driven future.

Keep In Mind
To wrap up this final module, you will finalize your AI-driven transformation course project. As you bring all the pieces that you have worked on over the past seven weeks together, be sure to keep the above steps in mind and ensure that you are addressing each of them in a satisfactory manner and consider how you could further refine your project.

## 4. Course Wrap-Up

You’ve done it! You now have the tools you need to help your organization co-create its AI-powered future. Keep in mind, the world of AI and technology never stops moving. As Dr. Westerman says, technology is the endless agitator of the business world (Westerman et al., 2014). Your project will create a plan fit for the current situation. But be sure to also include elements that will empower your organization to meet any future challenges and opportunities that might come along.

As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, uncertainty is inevitable. Embracing this uncertainty as part of the journey encourages experimentation, continuous learning, and resilience. Ultimately, it is through the combined mastery of leadership practices, technological proficiency, and stakeholder readiness that organizations will navigate complexity and co-create ways to thrive in the digital era.
