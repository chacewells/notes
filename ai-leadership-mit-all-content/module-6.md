# Module 6

## 1. Building a Digital- and AI-Ready Culture
In previous modules, we explored the digital mastery framework—the 2×2 matrix that can be used to evaluate an organization’s digital capability alongside its leadership capability.

We examined how a clear, compelling vision sets a unifying strategic direction; how robust engagement energizes employees to become active participants in change; and how effective governance mechanisms serve as both the steering wheel and the brakes, ensuring that transformation efforts remain aligned with organizational objectives.

As we move into this module, we will shift our focus to the remaining leadership capabilities that create the conditions for sustaining transformation over time. Specifically, we will examine technology leadership and building a digital- and artificial intelligence (AI)-ready culture. These capabilities enable organizations to integrate technological innovations effectively while nurturing an adaptive, forward-thinking organizational environment. Whereas vision, engagement, and governance are essential for initiating and managing change, technology leadership improves the digital platform and smooths relations between IT and business leaders and a strong, adaptive culture—shaped by, and reflective of, those foundational elements—creates the enduring environment in which innovation thrives.

Understanding Organizational Culture
Throughout this course we have seen that digital transformation is not a simple task of adopting a new technology. Successful digital transformation, as with previous technological changes in industry, requires changing the way an organization does business.

“Culture is what happens when the boss leaves the room.”
Anonymous

Organizational culture is more than just a set of abstract ideals—it is the shared values, goals, attitudes, and practices that define how an organization operates. It shapes the workplace environment, influences decision-making, and guides employee behavior. In many ways, company culture acts as the invisible force that determines how people collaborate, how challenges are approached, and how success is measured.

Management scholar Edgar Schein offered the following definition of organizational culture:

“Organizational culture is the pattern of basic assumptions which a given group has invented, discovered, or developed in learning to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration, which have worked well enough to be considered valid, and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems.”
Edgar H. Schein, 1983

This definition provides a strong foundation for understanding how the beliefs and actions of a group comprise its general culture.

At its core, organizational culture defines the “personality” of a business. Whether an organization emphasizes innovation, customer service, operational efficiency, or employee well-being, these priorities are reflected in everyday interactions and expectations. Culture is not simply a statement on a website or a slogan in the office; it is embedded in the processes, workflows, and decisions that drive the organization forward.

For instance, in an organization that values transparency, workflows may prioritize open communication and shared decision-making. Employees might regularly provide feedback, leadership may embrace open-door policies, and major business choices may be discussed collectively rather than dictated from the top down. In an organization that prioritizes speed and adaptability, decision-making might be decentralized and emphasize quickly experimenting with new approaches.

The way work gets done is also shaped by cultural expectations around collaboration, autonomy, and accountability. In a hierarchical company culture, processes might be highly structured, with clear chains of command and formal approval mechanisms. Conversely, a more flexible or entrepreneurial culture might encourage employees to take initiative, experiment with new solutions, and iterate quickly based on results.

For our purposes, we will contrast two types of culture.

Traditional cultures often emphasize stability, well-defined processes, and a clear hierarchy, ensuring consistency and minimizing risk. These cultures excel in industries where compliance, precision, and long-term planning are critical.

AI-ready cultures, on the other hand, prioritize adaptability, innovation, and rapid decision-making. They are built to embrace change, using and utilizing data, technology, and agile methods to stay competitive in fast-moving markets.

In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, marked by the increasing integration of AI across industries, organizations must cultivate an “AI-ready culture” to thrive. Such a culture is not merely about adopting the latest technologies but also about creating an environment that embraces change, empowers employees, and prioritizes ethical considerations.

Following Schein’s assertion that culture is built upon assumptions, digital- and AI-ready culture encourages curiosity and constant questioning. At its core, the transition away from traditional company culture is characterized by adaptability and innovation. In practice, this means the organization is fast, innovative, and continually ready for change. It prioritizes experimentation and learning over rigid adherence to traditional methods. This involves a willingness to experiment with AI and other digital tools and with new practices. Yet, it still has guardrails that manage risk while enabling innovation. Agility enables the company to quickly respond to new challenges and opportunities, turning potential disruptions into competitive advantages.

In addition, AI-ready culture requires a fundamental shift in perspective regarding the role of AI. Rather than viewing AI as a replacement for human workers, an AI-ready culture sees it as a tool for augmenting human capabilities. This ensures the focus shifts to how AI can assist employees in their tasks, freeing them up to concentrate on activities requiring creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving. By embracing this collaborative human-machine partnership, organizations can leverage the strengths of both humans and AI to drive innovation and achieve unprecedented levels of performance.

Key Components of an AI-Ready Culture
Organizational culture is shaped by the interplay of values, practices, and underlying assumptions. Among these, values are foundational—they guide what is considered appropriate, influence how people assess others’ actions, and shape how they approach their own work. When values are out of sync with actual practices, employees may question their authenticity. Likewise, if the values promoted by leadership do not align with the assumptions employees hold, resistance to change is likely. In such cases, leaders must help shift those assumptions to reflect new realities, or risk undermining the change effort.

In AI-ready organizations, aligned values, practices, and assumptions create a culture capable of embracing transformation. Leaders play a critical role in fostering these elements to build an environment that is not only agile and adaptive, but also equipped to deploy AI technologies in ways that are effective, ethical, and sustainable.

Values
Practices


Assumptions
Values
Dr. Westerman’s research identified four values that are dominant in AI-ready cultures (Westerman et al., 2019). While traditional cultures might also exhibit these values, AI-ready organizations typically promote all four of these values.

Speed
Impact
Autonomy
Openness
AI-ready organizations move fast and iterate quickly, rather than waiting to have all the answers. They prioritize speed over perfection, using rapid prototyping to test ideas and refine them based on feedback. Waiting for lengthy decision processes or detailed plans before acting can hinder progress in a digital environment. Sometimes, the only way to find the answer is to put something out and see what works.

It is important for leaders to both communicate these values and make them real for employees through actions and decisions. Leaders must also reinforce them through their own actions and by rewarding or correcting the actions of others. As we have seen from the examples of the companies above, leaders have made these values real through practices, not only touting them as slogans and philosophy statements.

Practices
The values shared by AI-ready organizations lead to the adoption of certain practices, to a greater or lesser degree. Members of organizations which value speed and autonomy are likely to practice rapid experimentation and prototyping, for example. The adoption of these practices falls along a spectrum, with AI-ready organizations more likely to rapidly experiment and exhibit data-driven decision-making, while traditional organizations are more likely to focus on stability and safety.

Rapid Experimentation

Testing ideas quickly and learning from the results

Self-Organizing Teams

Allowing teams to define their own workflows and make decisions collaboratively

Data-Driven Decision-Making

Using data to guide strategic choices and measure performance

Customer Obsession

Prioritizing customer needs and feedback in every aspect of the business

Results Orientation

Focusing on measurable outcomes rather than process adherence

Acting With Integrity

Maintaining ethical standards while pursuing innovation

Seeking Stability

Providing employees with a sense of security even in fast-changing environments

Strictly Conforming to Rules

Requiring employees to strictly adhere to established organizational rules

Spectrum of Practices
These practices exist on a spectrum, where some are more common in large traditional companies and others are more common in those born in the digital age. In what order do these practices belong? Which are common to AI-ready organizations? Which are common to traditional organizations? And which are shared by these two?

Drag each practice to the type of organization you think they fit.

Obsessing over customers: Maintaining continual focus on meeting the stated and unstated needs of current and potential customers
Seeking stability: Aiming for reliability and predictability in stakeholder interactions, operations, and employee work life
Rapid experimentation: Constantly and systematically experimenting, learning from the results, and quickly applying new insight
Focusing on results: Continually striving for measurable results instead of just processes and promises
Self-organizing: Collaborating fluidly across functional, geographic, hierarchical, and organizational boundaries to get things done
Driving decisions with data: Collecting and using accurate data to make decisions and solve problems
Acting with integrity: Being honest, behaving ethically, and striving for positive outcomes for all stakeholders
Strictly conforming to rules: Seeking to avoid problems and maintain reliability through rules

Except for strictly conforming to rules, which can inhibit innovation and change, the practices at the traditional end of the spectrum are not inherently undesirable. Certainly, some digital-native companies have faced criticism for ethical lapses. While rapid experimentation and self-organization fuel innovation, without the robust governance discussed in previous modules and overall guidance, employees can burn out or face abuse. The key challenge is to build a digital culture that drives innovation while upholding integrity and stability. Research shows that maintaining integrity and stability does not hinder innovation, profitability, or customer satisfaction, but rather helps traditional and maturing digital firms blend the best of both worlds.

Forum: Common Practices in Traditional vs. AI-Ready Cultures
For your organization, or one you are familiar with, consider the spectrum of practices above. In this forum, share which practice is most important for supporting a digital- and AI-ready culture. Which practice does your organization need to drop?


Assumptions
While values and practices provide a surface-level view of an organization’s AI-readiness, there is still a crucial layer of hidden assumptions that leaders must confront to truly support an AI-ready culture. Leaders may need to challenge legacy or pre-digital assumptions to enable the adoption of AI-ready values and practices.

“Assumptions are not bad or good. They’re an essential part of how we think and act.”
Dr. George Westerman

Assumptions act as guiding principles in our work, but leaders need to be mindful of them across various facets of their organization. It is crucial for leaders in the digital age to recognize prevailing assumptions, understand when to use them, question them, and think differently about them. (Brown, 2022)

In the workplace, assumptions can be valuable as they align people along a common viewpoint and create a shared language and way of decision-making. But they can also reinforce prevailing unconscious biases, which can cause people to resist transformation. (Brown, 2022)

Consider some common organizational assumptions. Are they held in your organization?

Digital Transformation Is a Technological Challenge
The Regulators (or the Unions) Will Never Let Us Do That
Customers Value the Human Touch
Employees Will Work the Way We Tell Them To
Assignment: Rethinking Management Assumptions in AI-Driven Digital Transformation
The hidden assumptions of an organization’s culture may hinder the acceptance of AI-ready values or the adoption of AI-ready practices if they are not aligned. In this assignment, you will identify assumptions that you believe organizations in general or in your field will need to question as they prepare an AI-ready culture.


Reflect
When transformations fail, people often point to culture as the culprit. Famed management scholar Peter Drucker often said “culture eats strategy for lunch.” But culture is not an immutable thing. It is created by the way leaders lead, hence leaders can change it if they lead properly. Doing so means adjusting and aligning three key elements of culture—vision, practices, and assumptions—and then constantly reinforcing them with everything you say and do. This does not have to happen only at the top of the company. Leaders can build the right culture in the units they control, even if the rest of the organization is not yet ready.

How have you seen leaders build or reinforce the right (or wrong) culture? As a leader, what will you do to steer your organization’s culture, at any level, in the right direction?

## 2. Technology Leadership
In the landscape of digital and AI transformation, the relationship between IT and the business units is crucial for success. Too often viewed as a support function, IT must evolve into a strategic enabler that drives innovation and competitive advantage. This transition requires a fundamental shift in mindset, organizational structure, and leadership approach for both technology and business leaders. It has become more complicated in recent years as some organizations have created digital teams separate from IT, others have hired technology people in business units, and many have begun to create AI-focused groups separate from all of them.

From Support to Strategic Enablement
The Importance of the IT-Business Relationship
The shift from order-taker to strategic partner requires a change in mindset, skill sets, and organizational structures. It requires leaders on both sides to build mutual trust and shared understanding (Siamonova et al., 2024). IT leaders must gain greater awareness of business strategies, and business leaders must develop a deeper understanding of technology. They must understand each other's perspectives and believe they can collaborate to achieve their goals. These two must work together to address their legacy IT systems, which can be built in compromised or entangled ways. The following sections will explore the key steps organizations can take to position IT and its leaders for success in the age of AI.

Who Transforms the Digital Platform: IT or Business Leaders?
One of the most essential functions of IT leaders is building and overseeing the digital platform. A robust digital platform is the cornerstone of digital transformation, comprising the technology, applications, and data that drive a company’s business processes (Bonnet & Westerman, 2020). This platform has three key elements: the core platform, the externally facing platform, and the data platform—each essential to creating a seamless digital experience.

### Core

The core platform forms the technology backbone. It supports operational and transactional systems—such as back-office systems and systems of record—that underpin a company's critical processes. To be effective, the core platform must be well-structured, efficiently managed, and kept as simple as possible to meet its essential functions.
### External Facing

The externally facing platform, powers websites, mobile apps, and other channels that connect the business with its customers and partners. It not only provides an attractive interface but also integrates with the core system to handle transactions like payments, while enabling agile customer-facing experiments and personalized experiences.
### Data

The data platform aggregates diverse data sources—ranging from images and voice to other media—to enhance both customer experience and internal operations. By enabling systems and employees to convert raw data into actionable insights, the data platform fuels digital innovation and supports informed decision-making.
Source: (Bonnet & Westerman, 2020)

For instance, a retail company might rely on its core platform for processing transactions, use its externally facing platform to deliver personalized shopping experiences, and leverage its data platform to analyze consumer trends—all working in concert to drive business growth and operational efficiency.

Although IT and business leaders bring different expertise to the table, they cannot operate in isolation. Key decisions must be made through collaboration, not simply handed off. Successful transformation depends on more than just technical skill—it requires mutual understanding and shared accountability. IT leaders need to speak the language of business, focusing on value rather than just technical merit. In turn, business leaders must recognize how their choices impact the platform’s cost, security, and agility, and involve IT in critical decisions.

To enable this, both sides must foster a culture of shared standards and open collaboration without compromising speed or execution. This partnership aligns technology efforts with strategic business goals, driving innovation and long-term advantage. Building such a partnership starts with elevating IT to strategic roles and strengthening communication between both groups.

The Evolving Role of IT: From Order-Taker to Strategic Partner
The rise of AI and digital technologies is redefining the role of IT, demanding a more proactive and integrated approach. IT’s functions must now extend beyond traditional support to become integral in shaping strategy, driving innovation, and ensuring the secure and effective deployment of AI solutions.

It may be helpful to think of this process as akin to building a new house on top of an old foundation. Leaders are not erasing the department’s history, but they are building something new and modern.

It is essential to involve the IT team right from the start. Evolving from support to strategic enabler means that the IT department is not only there to simply “keep the lights” on anymore. They know details on business processes and how they link with each other. They possess necessary expertise in data management, cybersecurity, and cloud computing, and are therefore essential for making this transformation successful.

They are the architects of this new digital house, ensuring everything is built right and ready for the future.

Developing Mutual Trust and Shared Understanding
Ensuring the IT team successfully evolves requires IT leaders to transition from tactical implementers to strategic decision-makers. To truly thrive in the age of AI, organizations must empower IT and digital leaders to be equal partners in shaping strategy, driving innovation, and creating competitive advantage. This is not a one-way street. Of course, business leaders reshape their organizations and products, but tech leaders must build understanding of the business so that they can see the rationale and suggest alternative approaches. They often have very good ideas about what is possible and what challenges may exist, but may need to learn to communicate in business terms. This means developing a strong understanding of business principles, possessing business savvy, and playing a leading role in driving transformation and business process improvement.

To achieve this evolution, consider these points:

### Evolving Expectations

The role of the IT leader is changing due to AI and digital transformation. IT leaders need to possess a strong understanding of business principles, market dynamics, and competitive landscapes. They are now expected to contribute to strategy rather than just execute tasks.

### Strategic Alignment

IT strategy must align with overall business goals, positioning IT leaders as key players in achieving these objectives.
In many ways, IT leaders and business leaders have existed in different worlds with a different understanding of needs and objectives. And it is important to remember, not every IT person needs to do this, just the ones that work with business leaders or build applications for the business. For example, when IT and business leaders plan an AI innovation, they are likely to consider certain aspects from their different points of view. IT leaders may focus more on how maintainable a system will be after it is built, or how it integrates with other systems. Business leaders, on the other hand, may be more focused on achieving their specific goals quickly, in the way they want to do it. Many times, these two groups may be “speaking a different language.” While neither side is incorrect, discussions may be hampered due to lack of perspective and misunderstandings of the other point of view.(Westerman, 2012)

One clear example of what can happen when IT and business leaders do not communicate well is the creation of “legacy spaghetti.”


Technology leaders use the term “spaghetti” to describe how older systems in traditional companies often become tangled and overly interconnected. These legacy systems can slow down decision-making, increase maintenance costs, and reduce the overall agility of the organization. The challenge lies in untangling these systems without disrupting core operations. Transitioning from legacy spaghetti to “ravioli” systems involves breaking down monolithic systems into smaller, self-contained components that can be easily changed without affecting other components, and rearranged into new combinations. This architectural shift enables greater flexibility, faster deployments, and improved system resilience, making the organization more adaptive to technological change.

The creation of “spaghetti” through the misalignment of business and IT goals and capabilities underlines the need for opening lines of communication between IT leaders and business leaders. As IT leaders are brought more closely into strategic decision-making it is essential for successful digital transformations that IT perspectives are not only heard but are also drivers of change. In the end, both sides need to learn how to talk on the other’s terms and how to express their goals in a way the other side can understand.

For IT professionals aspiring to be seen as strategic business partners rather than just support staff, self-reflection is essential. Ask yourself:

Am I positioning myself as a business enabler or just a technical expert?
Am I communicating in a way that business leaders understand, or am I only speaking in technical jargon?
Do I demonstrate value through measurable outcomes?
Building trust and credibility is key. If colleagues see you as competent, reliable, and able to understand their challenges, they will be more willing to collaborate and involve you in decision-making.

Agility in Technology Leadership
Agile is a flexible product development approach that emphasizes speed, collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback. Emerging in the 1990s as a response to rigid traditional methods, Agile was formalized in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto (Beck et al., 2001), which prioritizes individuals, working solutions, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change. Unlike sequential processes like Waterfall, Agile operates in short iterative cycles (sprints), enabling teams to continuously refine their work.

Agile methodology, when implemented correctly, provides a structured yet flexible approach to managing projects that achieve results quickly. A crucial element is having a product owner—someone from the business side who has the authority to make decisions and implement changes in real time. This eliminates long delays caused by waiting for executive approvals or steering committee meetings. Instead, decisions can be made immediately or within a day, accelerating progress and clarity.

Agile is about breaking large problems into manageable pieces, and iterating to learn continuously. However, a common challenge is aligning Agile processes with traditional business expectations. Agile teams often struggle to commit to delivering specific features by a set date because the process is inherently about discovery. Instead of rigid deliverables, goals should be framed in terms of outcomes such as increasing revenue or improving customer satisfaction. Then the agile teams, collaborating with the product owner, can iteratively develop features that achieve those goals.

Early adopters of Agile faced resistance from leaders accustomed to structured, long-term planning. Over time, organizations learned that Agile is not about having a fixed roadmap but about refining the solution through ongoing development.

Traditional Waterfall vs. Agile
A key leadership decision is knowing when to move quickly and when a more deliberate approach is needed. In the past, IT systems were built like factories—designed entirely upfront before execution. That model made sense when development cycles were long and resources were scarce. However, today’s fast-moving business environment requires a different mindset.

Leaders should ask:

In what situations does a traditional approach add value?
When does using a traditional approach, instead of an agile one, create unnecessary risk?
For industries driven by customer experience and rapid innovation, sticking to a fixed plan is often a mistake. Instead, the best approach is to experiment, iterate, and refine solutions based on real-world feedback.

Major transformations with generative AI are still evolving, but most companies are taking incremental steps to build capability while managing risks. Many organizations are keeping humans in the loop to refine AI models and maintain oversight. This measured approach allows businesses to develop AI expertise while mitigating uncertainty.

Successfully implementing Agile requires strong leadership and often benefits from an experienced Agile coach. Once a few teams see success with Agile, leadership can address resistance by highlighting those wins.

A common challenge is getting hesitant teams on board. Rather than forcing compliance, leaders should encourage conversation: “Why are some teams able to work effectively in this model while others have challenges?” Most Agile teams ultimately report higher productivity, faster decision-making, a greater sense of accomplishment, and often better work-life-balance. The key is to start pilots with a mix of individuals—not just the most innovative employees—to prove that Agile can work across the organization.

By focusing on gradual adoption and alignment with business goals, organizations can navigate digital transformation more effectively.

3. Helping Employees Feel Ready for the Future
Having a workforce that is prepared, willing, and able to embrace change facilitates the development of an AI-ready culture and the process of digital transformation in traditional organizations as well as those seeking the final move to digital mastery. As discussed in the previous sections, establishing a forward-thinking culture and improving mutual trust and shared understanding among IT and business leaders are foundational steps. However, none of this can be successful if employees do not feel ready for the change.

Employees will be more comfortable and confident with change if they have the skills, knowledge, and mindset to thrive in an AI-powered future. Reciprocally, these employees will be better able to engage in the types of change leaders are driving. Cultivating such a workforce involves continual development, aided by understanding the broad reach of digital transformation. We will dive deeper into this important issue in a later module.

Organizations must focus on agile and career-oriented learning, recognizing that digital transformation affects all roles, not just those traditionally considered “technical.” This entails providing accessible, personalized learning experiences and offering clear pathways for career advancement. By creating a culture that values continuous growth, transparent communication, and proactive engagement, leaders can empower their employees to not only adapt to change but also to drive innovation and achieve their full potential.

In previous modules, we saw examples of AI-powered digital transformation’s reach and how workers’ tasks are being augmented by AI and ML systems. However, these examples were all focused on processes, operations, or products, and AI was largely framed as a tool for improving efficiency, reducing costs, or creating new business opportunities. While these are critical aspects of digital transformation, they represent only part of the picture. The full potential of AI-driven transformation lies not just in what it changes externally, but in how it can support internal, human-centered growth.

Ultimately, effective leadership is less about the technology itself and more about the art of leading people through change. Digital transformation transcends the mere implementation of new tools and systems; it is fundamentally about cultivating a people-centric culture where every individual is valued, engaged, and equipped to grow. Leaders must focus on empowering their teams, encouraging an environment of trust, and enabling open communication to help employees navigate and embrace the shift towards a digital future. By centering their approach on the human element of transformation, leaders can build resilient, innovative teams that drive sustainable organizational success.

Conclusion
When we shift our focus to the workforce itself, we see that AI is also a catalyst for individual transformation. Beyond task augmentation, AI can help organizations identify skill gaps, personalize learning pathways, and deliver retraining at scale—making it a key enabler of workforce development. In this way, AI becomes not just a system of productivity, but a system of empowerment. Having an engaged, future-ready workforce is essential to any successful digital transformation initiative. In a future module, we will explore how organizations can support employees in transforming their skills, mindsets, and roles to participate fully in the digital era.
