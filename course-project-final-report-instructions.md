# Course Project Part 8: Final Report

Brief Description: This assignment is mandatory and will therefore be evaluated as part of your final grade. This assignment must be completed individually.

This final course project assignment asks you to consolidate and synthesize your work throughout the course into a comprehensive strategic report. This is not simply a collection of previous submissions, but a cohesive document that demonstrates your ability to think critically and strategically about artificial intelligence (AI) integration within your professional context.

You will present your project in its entirety, clearly outlining the problem or opportunity, the role of AI, the leadership considerations, and anticipated implementation challenges. Additionally, you will reflect on which aspects of the project may be most difficult to carry out in a real-world setting and what adaptations or leadership approaches might be required.

This report should reflect both strategic thinking and practical awareness. It is intended as a working document you could confidently share with stakeholders in your organization or field.

## Instructions: Your report should include the following sections:

### 1. Executive Summary (150–250 words)

Briefly summarize the purpose, approach, and expected impact of your project. This section should be clear enough for someone unfamiliar with your work to understand its significance. You can adapt your elevator pitch for this section.

### 2. Problem or Opportunity Statement

Describe the specific challenge or opportunity you identified. Include context on why this is important to address now, and how it aligns with broader organizational or industry goals.

### 3. AI Integration Strategy

Explain how AI, particularly generative AI, is being used to address the challenge or opportunity. Identify the tools or technologies involved and how they support the objectives. Include reference to your GenAI cost equation and any automation considerations.

### 4. Leadership Alignment

Discuss how your project engages with the five leadership capabilities from the Digital Mastery Framework. Provide specific examples from your project to illustrate how these capabilities are reflected or activated.

### 5. Implementation Considerations

Identify what steps would be required to move your project from concept to implementation. Discuss potential barriers (technical, cultural, ethical, logistical) and how you might address them.

### 6. Reflection on Real-World Application

Reflect on which aspects of your project are likely to be most challenging to implement in practice. Why might they be difficult? What organizational, team, or leadership strategies would help overcome those challenges?

### 7. Final Insights and Next Steps

Conclude with your personal takeaways from the course and the project process. If you were to pursue this initiative in your organization, what would your first three concrete steps be?

### Final Note

This report marks the conclusion of the course, but it does not have to be the end of your project. You are encouraged to continue developing your initiative beyond this assignment—refining your ideas, testing assumptions, and even collaborating with peers from the course. Consider transforming your final report into a whitepaper, case study, or thought leadership article that can be shared on LinkedIn or other professional platforms. Doing so not only helps advance your project but also demonstrates your commitment to digital leadership and strategic innovation in the AI era.
